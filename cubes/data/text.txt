#FOR THE NEXT ISSUE,
WE WILL NEED YOUR
SUPPORT IN FORM OF
FILLED VOTESHEETS.
THE MORE PEOPLE FILL
OUT VOTES, THE
BETTER AND MORE
ACCURATE THE CHARTS.

THANKS IN ADVANCE
FOR YOUR HELP!
#WE'D LIKE TO THANK
EVERYONE WHO VOTED
IN THE LAST ISSUE.
VERSUS WOULD NOT BE
POSSIBLE WITHOUT
YOUR SUPPORT!
SPEAKING OF VOTING,
WE'LL BE MAKING SOME
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE
VOTING SYSTEM, SO
STAY TUNED FOR THAT!

#A BIG WELCOME TO
GHANDY WHO JOINED
THE VERSUS EDITOR
TEAM NOT LONG AGO.
MANY WILL REMEMBER
HIS GREAT WORK IN
MAGAZINES LIKE
D.I.S.C AND SHOWTIME
BACK IN THE DAY.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO
WORKING WITH HIM.

#VOTING HAS NOT
STARTED YET, BUT
YOU CAN ALWAYS
CONTRIBUTE WITH
ARTICLES THAT WE
WILL PUBLISH ON
CLASSIC AMIGA, OS4,
SMARTPHONES AND
ONLINE. MAKE YOUR
VOICE FOR THE AMIGA
SCENE HEARD!

#BY THE WAY, DID YOU
KNOW THAT VERSUS IS
THE ONLY AMIGA
CHARTMAG STILL BEING
RELEASED SINCE 2006
AND THAT IT HAS BEEN
ALIVE AND KICKING
SINCE 2004?
