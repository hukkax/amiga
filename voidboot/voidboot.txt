VoidBoot by hukka/void

Genre: Amiga intro (1K)
Platform: Amiga OCS/ECS/AGA

Info: My first attempt at a simple bootblock intro (1024 bytes). Greets to exec!

To orgs: ADF contains the bootblock both as an actual bootblock and as a
separate executable "voidboot.exe" (somewhat larger due to additional init/exit
code), should also be runnable from Workbench. Quits via left mouse click only
due to size constraints.
